Improved version of the Avondale College, Auckland project:
https://github.com/JDCRecomendable/unit-converter-old

## Preamble
This project is the product of a project required by the NCEA Curriculum,
Standard AS91906. This project was overseen by teachers from Avondale
College, Auckland.

## About
Unit Converter is a WinForms-based unit conversion software project that aims
to provide a streamlined interface for unit conversion for students, scientists
and businesses. Included in the program is support for over 370 different
pre-defined units categorised into 16 different physical quantities. In
addition, to support the needs of certain users, the program permits the
addition of custom units.

The program is free/libre and open-source software. The source code is
structured to allow for easy modification by other parties. Specifically,
the core classes are split from the front-end-specific classes. As well,
a definitions file is included that lists pre-defined units and their relative
values to the S.I. unit of their physical quantities.

## Caveats
* Custom units at the moment cannot be saved and will have to be manually added
at the next launch.

## Future Directions
* Allow custom units to be saved by the program and loaded automatically on
start-up without user intervention.
* Allow the automated processing of multiple conversions. E.g. values to be
converted can be stored in a CSV file that can then be loaded, read and
processed by the program.
